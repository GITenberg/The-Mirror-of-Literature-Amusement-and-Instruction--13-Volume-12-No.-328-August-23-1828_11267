<p>AKENSIDE</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Gentle, courteous, and <i>patient</i> reader&mdash;to understand
the above plan, it is requisite that you carry your mind's eye back
to those troublous times when men enjoyed no protection, but in
opposing force to force; and to a period when <i>every man's house
was his castle</i>, though not in the metaphorical sense we have
since been accustomed to apply these words, viz. to the protection
and security of British subjects.</p>
<p>Few portions of our island have been more amply illustrated, by
antiquarians, than OXFORD; and from one of these we learn that a
Keep Tower, or Castle, existed here a considerable time before the
conquest; for Alfred lived here; and Harold Harefoot was crowned
and resided here; and one of Alfred's sons struck money here.
Hearne has likewise identified this fact by the very ancient and
original arms of Oxford, which have a castle represented, with a
large ditch and bridge. Upon the same authority we learn that Offa
"built walls at Oxford," and by him, therefore, a Saxon castle was
originally built at Oxford.</p>
<p>Leland, Dugdale, and Camden, on the other hand, affirm that the
castle at Oxford was built by Robert D'Oiley, who came into England
with William the Conqueror; and the Chronicles of Osney Abbey,
preserved in the Cottonian library, even ascertain the precise date
of this great baron's undertaking, viz. A.D. 1071. No question,
therefore, can remain, but that this illustrious chieftain either
repaired or rebuilt the castle; but as we have shown, upon equal
authority, there was a Saxon castle, fit for a royal residence at
Oxford, long previous to D'Oiley's time. About the year 1794,
several Saxon remains were discovered here; but our engraving
represents the castle in Norman times, with Robert D'Oiley's
magnificent additions, and is a facsimile of a plan by Ralph Agas,
in 1538, which, allowing a little for bad or unskilful drawing, may
be taken as a perfect specimen of Norman military architecture, and
will, we are persuaded, be received by our readers as <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> a
popular and interesting illustration of the warlike character of
the age in which the castle was erected.</p>
<p>For the description we are indebted to a MS. account of Anthony
Wood, in the Bodleian library, who informs us that at one of its
entrances was "a large bridge, which led into a long and broad
entry, and so to the chief gate of the castle, the entry itself
being fortified, on each side, with a large embattled wall; and
having several passages above, from one side to the other, with
open spaces between them, through which, in times of storm,
whenever any enemy had broken through the first gates of the
bridge, and was gotten into the entry, scalding water or stones
might be cast down to annoy them."</p>
<p>On passing through the gate, at the end of this long entry, the
fortification stretched itself, on the left hand, in a straight
line, till it came to a <i>round</i> tower, that was rebuilt in the
19th of Henry III.<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> And from
thence went a fair embattled wall, guarded for the most part with
the mill-stream underneath, till it came to the high tower joining
to St. George's church.<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>From hence, says the manuscript, the wall went to another gate,
now quite down, opposite to the abovementioned; and leading to
Osney, over another bridge; close to which joined that lofty and
eminent mount, sometime crowned with an embattled tower. The
manuscript adds, that for the greater defence of this castle, there
was, on one of the sides of it, <i>a barbican</i>; which seems to
have not merely been a single tower, but (according to an ancient
deed) <i>a place</i>, or outwork, containing several habitations;
and from other accounts it further appears, that there were more
barbicans than one.</p>
<p>The ruins of certain other towers of the castle, besides the
barbicans, and those already described, are also said to have been
standing till 1649; when they were pulled down to erect new
bulwarks for the parliamentary garrison.</p>
<p>This is an abstract of Anthony Wood's manuscript, which agrees
with Agas's drawing, except that in his sketch, the tower between
the gate-tower and St. George's, is represented square instead of
being round. Antiquarians also infer that in the drawing it was
intended to represent the great keep-tower as standing upon the top
of the mount, and not by the side of it.<a id="footnotetag3" name=
"footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Some discoveries made in 1794, throw much light on the history
of the castle, and warrant a conclusion that in its area were
several buildings. Wells were then cleared out, and among the
rubbish were found horses' bones, dogs' bones, horse-shoes, and
human skeletons; the appearance of the latter is not easily
accounted for, unless they were the bodies of malefactors, who had
been executed on the gallows placed near the castle, in later ages,
that might have been flung in here, instead of being buried under
the gibbet. We must however pass over many interesting facts, and
content ourselves with a mere reference to the empress Maud being
besieged here in 1141, and her miraculous flight with three
knights, all escaping the eyes of the besiegers by the brightness
of their raiment; Maud having just previously escaped from the
castle of the Devizes, as a dead corpse, in a funeral hearse or
bier. The reader will not be surprised at the decay of the castle,
when he is informed that it was in a dilapidated state in the reign
of Edward III.</p>
<p>The castle was situate on the west side of the city of Oxford,
on the site of the present county gaol. In 1788 little remained
except the tower, which was for some time used as the county
prison, and part of the old wall could then be traced 10 feet in
thickness. In the castle-yard were the remains of the ancient
sessions-house, in which, at the <i>Black Assize</i>, in 1577, the
lieutenant of the county, two knights, eighty esquires and
justices, and almost all the grand jury, died of a distemper,
brought thither and communicated by the prisoners; and nearly one
hundred scholars and townsmen fell victims to the same
disorder.</p>
<p>We have been somewhat minute in the preceding description, but
we hope not more so than the exhaustless curiosity of the public on
such subjects appears to warrant. Indeed, these interesting details
are only a tithe portion of what we might have abridged. The
warlike habits of our ancestors are always attractive topics for
inquirers into the history of mankind, and their study is not</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Dull and crabbed as some fools suppose,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but a treasury or depository of useful knowledge, by enabling
the inquirer <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name=
"page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> to draw many valuable inferences from
the comparative states of men in the several ages he seeks to
illustrate. The enthusiasm of such pursuits is, likewise, an
everlasting source of delight; for who can visit such shrines as
Netley, St. Albans, or Melrose, without feeling that he is on holy
ground; and although we are equally active in our notice of the
architectural triumphs of our own times, we must not entirely leave
the proud labours of by-gone ages to be clasped in the ponderous
folio, or to moulder and lie neglected on the upper shelves of our
libraries.</p>
<p>We have to acknowledge the loan of the original of the
engraving, from a lineal descendant of D'OILEY<a id="footnotetag4"
name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, the
founder or repairer of the Castle at Oxford&mdash;a name not
altogether unknown to our readers.</p>

<h2>THE "INTELLECTUAL CAT."</h2>
<h3>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h3>
<p>The <i>cat mania</i> has hitherto been more popular in France
than in England. To be sure, we have the threadbare story of
Whittington and his cat; Mrs. Griggs and her 86 living and 28 dead
cats; Peter King and his two cats in rich liveries; Foote's concert
of cats; and the newspaper story of tortoiseshell male
cats&mdash;but in France, cats keep better company, or at least are
associated with better names. Thus, MOLIERE had his favourite cat;
Madame de Puis, the celebrated harpplayer, settled a pension on her
feline friend, which caused a law-suit, and brought into action all
the most celebrated lawyers of France; and M. L'Abbe de Fontenu was
in the habit of experimenting on these animals, one of which he
found could exist twenty-six months without drinking! which fact is
recorded in the History of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris,
1753.</p>
<p>Our present portrait is, however, of more recent date, being a
free translation from <i>Le Furet de Londres</i>, a French paper
published in London, whose columns are an agreeable accompaniment
for a cup of coffee. It is a mere <i>bagatelle</i>, and as an
amusive trifle may not be unacceptable.</p>
<p>My pretty little Puss, it is high time that I should pay a just
tribute to your merits. We often talk of people who do not esteem
you; therefore, why should I blush to give publicity to your
perfection?</p>
<p>You are exceedingly well made; your fur boasts of the delicate
varieties of the tiger; your eyes are lively and pleasing; your
velvet coat and tail are of enviable beauty; and your agility,
gracefulness, and docility are, indeed, the admiration of all who
behold you! Your moral qualities are not less estimable; and we
will attempt to recapitulate them.</p>
<p>In the first place, you love me dearly, or at least you load me
with caresses; unless, like the rest of the world, you love me for
yourself's sake. I know well that you like me less than a slice of
mutton, or the leg of a fowl, but that is very simple; I am your
master, and a leg of mutton is as good again as one master, twice
as good as two masters, &amp;c.</p>
<p>You possess great sense, and good sense too, for you have
precisely such as is most useful to you; for every other kind of
knowledge will make you appear foolish.</p>
<p>Nature has given you nails, which men unpolitely call claws;
they are admirably constructed, and well jointed in a membrane,
which is extended or drawn up like the fingers of a glove; and at
pleasure it becomes a terrific claw, or a paw of velvet.</p>
<p>You understand the <i>physical laws of good and evil</i>. A cat
who strangles another will not be more culpable than a man who
kills his fellow men. My dear Cat, the great Hobbes never reasoned
more clearly than you do!</p>
<p>You forget the past&mdash;you dream not of the future; but you
turn the present to account. Time flies not with you, but stands
still, and all your moments appear but as one. You know that your
muscles will give action to your limbs, and you know no other cause
of your existence, than existence itself. My dear Cat, you are a
profound <i>materialist</i>!</p>
<p>You flatter the master who caresses you, you lick the hand that
feeds you, you fly from a larger animal than yourself, whilst you
unsparingly prey on the smaller ones. My dear Cat, you are a
profound <i>politician</i>!</p>
<p>You live peaceably with the dog, who is your messmate; in
gratitude to me, you regulate your reception, good or bad, of all
the animals under my roof; thus, you raise your claw against such
as you imagine mine enemies, while you prick up your tail at the
sight of my friends. My dear Cat, you are a profound
<i>moralist</i>!</p>
<p>When you promenade your graceful <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page116" name="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> limbs upon a roof, on
the edge of a casement, or in some situation equally perilous, you
show your dexterity in opposing the bulk of your body to the
danger. Your muscles extend or relax themselves with judgment, and
you enjoy security where other animals would be petrified with
fear. My dear Cat, you perfectly understand the <i>laws of
gravity</i>!</p>
<p>If through inadvertence, blundering, or haste, you lose your
support or hold, then you are admirable; you bend yourself in
raising your back, and carry the centre of gravity towards the
umbilical region, by which means you fall on your feet. My dear
Cat, you are an excellent <i>natural philosopher</i>!</p>
<p>If you travel in darkness, you expand the pupil of your eye,
which, in forming a perfect circle, describes a larger surface, and
collects the greater part of the luminous rays which are scattered
in the atmosphere. When you appear in daylight, your pupil takes an
elliptic form, diminishes, and receives only a portion of these
rays, an excess of which would injure your retina. My dear Cat, you
are a perfect <i>optician</i>!</p>
<p>When you wish to descend a precipice, you calculate the distance
of the solid points with astonishing accuracy. In the first place,
you dangle your legs as if to measure the space, which you divide
in your judgment, by the motions of your feet; then you throw
yourself exactly upon the wished-for spot, the distance to which
you have compared with the effect on your muscles. My dear Cat, you
are a skilful <i>geometrician</i>!</p>
<p>When you wander in the country, you examine plants with
judicious nicety; you soon select that kind which pleases you, when
you roll yourself on it, and testify your joy by a thousand other
gambols; you know also the several grasses, and their medicinal
effects on your frame. My dear Cat, you are an excellent
<i>botanist</i>!</p>
<p>Your voice merits no less eulogium; for few animals have one so
modulated. The rhyming pur of satisfaction, the fawning accents of
appeal, the vigorous bursts of passion, and innumerable diatonic
varieties, proceed from your larynx, according to the order of
nature. My dear Cat, you are a <i>dramatic musician</i>!</p>
<p>In your amusements, you prefer pantomime to dialogue; and you
neglect the pen to study the picture. But then what agility! what
dancing! what cross-capers! The difficulty never impairs the grace
of the feat. Oh, my dear Cat! you are a <i>delightful
dancer</i>!</p>
<p>Lastly, my dear Puss, show me a man who possesses as many kinds
of knowledge as you do, and I will proclaim him a <i>living
cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, or concentration of human wisdom. But, what
do I see? I am praising you, and you are fast asleep! This is still
greater philosophy.</p>

<h3>"TROUT BINNING" IN WEST-MORELAND.</h3>
<h4>(<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;"Now is the time,</p>
<p>While yet the dark-brown water aids the guile,</p>
<p>To tempt the trout."</p>
<p>THOMSON.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I have not yet done with this subject; and as it strikes me you
are an angler, I think the article a seasonable <i>bait</i> for
you.</p>
<p>I was certainly much entertained with your extracts from Sir
Humphry Davy's <i>Salmonia</i>; and from your being pleased to
mention my name in commenting on its merits, I took the hint, and
resolved to send you another leaf from my journal. You will easily
imagine the abundance of fish in Westmoreland when I inform you,
that they seldom use the line there, except in rivers, since they
can take them much easier with their hands as before mentioned. I
will now account for the trout frequenting such small brooks. There
are frequent floods in that county, at certain periods of the year,
which sweep the fish in shoals from the mountain rivulets,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>[pg
117]</span> or perhaps the fish always go down with the flood, for
the rivers and rivulets are all well stocked afterwards; and in my
opinion it is on account of the rivers being so full, that great
quantities are obliged to inhabit the neighbouring brooks, all
which empty themselves in the rivers. At the latter end of the
year, that is, the spawning season, the large trouts (which are
become very loose and flabby) take to the small brooks to deposit
their spawn; after which they return to the rivers. At this time
there are, in consequence, many young trouts, which remain, I
should imagine, till next year, when I believe they go to the
rivers; for during that time I have seldom caught trouts weighing
more than from half a pound to a pound, though in such a "beck" as
"Cannon's," which runs directly into the Eden, I have taken them at
all times very large&mdash;and this is how I account for the
difference. I should observe, that at the "<i>back end</i>" of the
year, immensely large trouts may be caught, which come up to spawn;
but they are generally, when caught, immediately thrown into their
element again, as they are worth nothing, on account of the
looseness of their flesh.</p>
<p>But to the subject. <i>Trout binning</i> is a name given to a
peculiar method of taking trout. A man wades any rocky stream
(Pot-beck for instance) with a sledge-hammer, with which he strikes
every stone likely to contain fish. The force of the blow stuns the
fish, and they roll from under the rock half dead, when the
"binner" throws them out with his hand.</p>
<p><i>Night-Fishing.</i>&mdash;I have frequently gone out with a
fishing party at about ten o'clock at night to spear trout. We
supplied ourselves with an eel spear and a lantern, and visited
Cannon's "beck." We drew the light gently over the water near the
brink. Immediately the light appeared, both trouts and eels were
splashing about the lantern in great quantities. We then took the
spear, and as they approached, thrust it down upon them, sometimes
bringing up with it three or four together. One night we took
nearly twenty pounds of trout and eels, which, for the short time
we were out, may be considered very fair sport, and some of those
were of a very large size.</p>
<p>Should you notice this, I may be led to recur to the subject in
a future paper.</p>

<p>Though I am as romantic a being as ever breathed on the face of
this beautiful earth; yet, I will promise the reader, that in
detailing the events of an interesting day, I will not tinge them
with that colouring; yet, such a glorious bard as Wordsworth could,
alone, do justice to our excursion. Leave him to wander alone in
that woody dell, with the thrilling picture spread around
him&mdash;the sinking walls of elaborate Gothic, clouded by the
hanging woods&mdash;the rural dwellings of the illiterate peasantry

the brick-and-mortar purlieus of home, and in company with two
young friends, commenced this excursion. The diversified chain of
the Hambleton Hills, bounding the fruitful valley of Mowbray, rose
at the distance of six miles before us; and whose summit we
intended reaching before breakfast. The varying aspect of these
rocky eminences requires the descriptive charms of Sir Walter
Scott, or the pencil of Salvator Rosa, to do them justice. Within
two miles of them, you might imagine yourself in the ruins of the
Roman amphitheatre, whose circular walls reared their dark-gray
forms to the heaven; and the inimitable description which Byron has
given us of that edifice, occurs to the recollection; though no
waving weeds and dew-nurtured trees crown the apparent
ruin&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Like laurel on the bald first Caesar's head."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On a nearer view, they change their appearance, and you might
suppose that the remains of some fortified castle, typical of the
feudal system, looked over the heather which clothes their rocky
sides; whilst the detached pieces of rock, which rolled from the
summit eighty years ago, appear amongst the furze, like the tombs
of Jewish patriarchs in the valley of <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page118" name="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> Jehosaphat at
Jerusalem, darkened by the lapse of ages. To the right of our path
lay the solitary and frail memorials of the monastery of Hode,
founded by Roger de Mowbray, and afterwards attached to the abbey
of Byland. Shortly after passing Hode, we arrived at the base of
Hambleton, and began to ascend its rocky front; we had climbed half
the ascent, when, on cautiously turning ourselves, an indescribable
picture presented itself in the vale and its objects below; the
solemn silence of the early hour&mdash;the first greeting of the
morning sun&mdash;the glittering and distant lake of Gormire,
guarded by towering hills to the right&mdash;and, to the left,
rocks which have stood whilst generations of heroes and kings have
passed away; and, beyond this vivid scene, in dim perspective,
arose the western hills, tinged with delicate blue, and scarcely
discernible from the clouds which floated over them. Even the
enraptured travellers, who stood gazing from the summit of Mont
Blanc, were not more delighted than the enthusiastic <i>trio</i>
who looked from the brow of Hambleton on that memorable morning.
But our object was not attained, and we set forward with
replenished vigour, to cross the heather-heath, whose bleak aspect
prepared us for the paradise which smiled below the other side of
the hills. The first prominent object which met our view, was the
terrace, with its classical temples at each of its terminations;
and next, the wood encircled hamlet of Scawton, at whose little
alehouse we enjoyed a hearty breakfast; and then set forward to
explore our beloved region of Rievaulx; our path being through a
mountainous wood, which nearly kissed the sky, and obscured the
rustic road which divided it: after several windings through this
leafy labyrinth, we arrived at a point where the wood was more
open, and the dell considerably wider. It was after passing a
picturesque cottage and bridge, that the first view of Rievaulx
Abbey broke upon us. It was then that the first outline of its
"Gothic grandeur" was displayed to us. Crossing the little bridge
of Rieval, we proceeded along the banks of the Rye, which morosely
rolled along, scarcely deigning to murmur its complaints to the
woody hills which skirted it, as if in pique for the ruin of its
sublime temple, and the disappearance of its monastic lords. The
village of Rieval, constructed out of the wreck of the spacious
abbey, displays some reverence for the preservation of inscriptions
dug out of the building; and the little windows which lit the cells
of studious monks five hundred years ago, now grace the cottages of
illiterate peasants. We took a facsimile of one inscription, in
Saxon letters, merely denoting the name of the monastery.</p>
<p>The rustic beauty of the hamlet has been copiously eulogized by
antiquarians and provincial historians. The beautiful foliage of
its trees, varying in colour, appears like fleecy clouds of
verdure, rising one above the other, over which a still deeper
shadow is cast by the towering woods on each side of the valley;
and in the midst of this fairy region, as if conscious of its proud
pre-eminence, rises the sacred edifice, clothed in mourning of
nature's deepest shade:<a id="footnotetag5" name=

<p>and threw the glowing emblazonry of the tinted pane upon the
Mosaic pavement of the choir; while the loud and slowly-pealing
matin reverberated through the sumptuous church. Here was interred
with ceremony of waxen taper and mid-night requiem, the noble
founder of this dilapidated fane, Sir Walter L'Espec, beneath that
wreck of pillar and architrave and those carved remains of the
chisel's achievement&mdash;he who deemed that the sepulchre</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Should canopy his bones till doomsday;</p>
<p>But all things have their end."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ruins of this religious house are more entire and superb
than any other in the kingdom. The nave of the church is wholly
gone; but the choir, one of its aisles, great part of the tower,
and both the transepts, still remain. The church, instead of being
east and west, approaches more to the direction of north and south;
so that the choir is at the south end, and the aisle which should
have been north, is on the east. Some have supposed this anomaly to
be produced at the rebuilding of the church; but Drake in his
"Evenings in Autumn," thinks it was in consequence of the
disposition of the ground, which forms a lofty mount on the east.
Adjoining the ruins of the nave on the west, are the remains of the
cloisters, measuring one hundred feet each way. On the opposite
side stands a splendid building, extending in length towards the
west one hundred feet, and in breadth <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page119" name="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> thirty; this structure
appears to have been the refectory, accompanied by a music gallery.
Parallel to this, and in a line with the transept, is another
extensive ruin, several feet longer than the refectory, and about
the same breadth, which was the dormitory; at the west end of which
the walls are ancient, and seem to be coeval with the original
abbey.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href=
"#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> The form and ground plan of this
building are the same with the abbey of Whitby; though the latter
is not so copious in its dimensions. Several members of the noble
families of Ross, Scroop, Maltbys, and Oryby, were interred in the
chapter-house and choir here. Aelred, the third abbot of Rievaulx,
was a man of great literary qualifications, and this abbey
possessed an extensive library, which was destroyed by the Scots,
in one of their lawless incursions&mdash;when the studious produce
of the holy brotherhood, assembled by years of incessant study was
committed to the reckless flames&mdash;and doubtless amongst the
collection were many works of the learned abbot Aelred; a character
from whom we might suppose the "northern magician" had sketched the
striking portraiture of the enthusiastic father Eustace, in his
"Monastery."</p>
<p>After inspecting this interesting edifice, we left its hallowed
precincts, and took the hilly path leading to a beautiful terrace,
which overlooks the vale; each end of which is decorated with two
modern temples, one in the Grecian and the other in the Roman style
of architecture. Here are some gaudy copies of the old masters,
with some originals, which adorn the centre and side compartments
of the ceiling&mdash;Guido's Aurora, (copy); Hero and Leander;
Diana and Endymion; Hercules and Omphale, &amp;c,&mdash;the whole
by the pencil of Bernini, an Italian artist. From this terrace the
view is enchanting; the distant hills of barren Hambleton subsiding
into the fruitful vale; and nearer, fertile fields intersected with
wood and mossy rocks; and immediately beneath the eye, the pale and
ivied ruin, mouldering over the dust of heroes who fought at
Cressy, and of noble pilgrims who died in the Holy Land, and were
conveyed to this far-famed sanctuary for interment&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Which now lies naked to the injuries</p>
<p>Of stormy weather."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Not far from this Elysium is the seat of Lord Feversham, (late
Charles S. Duncombe, Esq.) the owner of the estate, called Duncombe
Park, where is a piece of fine sculpture, called the Dog of
Alcibiades, said to be the work of Myron, and ranked among the five
dogs of antiquity. Here is also the famous Discobolus, which is
esteemed the first statue in England. Among the splendid collection
of paintings is a candle-light scene (woman and child) by Rubens,
which cost 1,500 guineas. The mansion was designed by Sir J.
Vanbrugh. Leaving this bewitching retreat, we proceeded down the
sides of the woody mount; and after some tedious inquiries
respecting our road through this wild region, we were directed to
take a path through a sloping wood; but useless are all attempts to
describe our route through this wilderness. Sometimes our weary
feet were relieved from the rough stones and briars by an
intervening lawn; and at others we were entirely shrouded from
"day's garish eye" by entwining trees. Our rugged pilgrimage was
rendered more endurable by the anticipation of shortly seeing
Byland abbey; but still my romantic spirit was loitering in the
pillared aisles of Rievaulx. By and by we quitted the wood, and
having descended a deep ravine, we climbed a barren moor, over
which we had proceeded half way, when to my unutterable joy, we
discovered the far-off fane of Rievaulx, whose wan towers just
peered from out of the hanging woods. Pursuing our way we soon
exchanged the trackless moor for a much more grateful domain. A
sloping wood on each side of us opened into a wider expanse, and
the turrets of Byland abbey appeared in the distance. At this
moment we forgot the toil of threading harassing woods and crossing
wide heaths. After refreshing ourselves we proceeded to view the
ruin.</p>
<p>Byland abbey was founded in 1177, by the famous Roger de
Mowbray, who amply endowed it, and was buried here. He retired
hither after being perplexed and fatigued with useless crusades,
and suffering the deprivation of nearly all his property by Henry
II. Martin Stapylton, Esq. the present proprietor of Byland,
discovered from some ancient manuscripts the precise situation in
the ruin, where were deposited the bones of the illustrious
chieftain; and after removing these relics of mortality which had
been hid for six hundred years, he conveyed them in his carriage to
Myton, and interred them in the church-yard. The abbey of Byland is
memorable for having given concealment, (though not a sanctuary!)
to Edward II. who, when flying from his enemies in the north, in
1322, took shelter here, and was surprised by them when at dinner,
narrowly escaping, by the swiftness of his horse, to York; and
leaving his money, plate, and privy seal, a booty to the savage and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>[pg
120]</span> exterminating Scots. Byland abbey has nearly
disappeared; the only perfect remains are the west end, a fine
specimen of Saxon and Gothic, and a small portion of the choir. The
church, its transepts, north and south aisles, and chancel, are
gone; and the dormitory, refectory, cloisters, &amp;c. have
scarcely left any trace of their gorgeous existence. The lonely ash
and sturdy briar vegetate over the ashes of barons and prelates;
and the unfeeling peasants intrude their rustic games on the holy
place, ignorant of its former importance, and unconscious of the
poetical feeling which its remains inspire. We quitted its interior
to inspect a gateway situated at a considerable distance from the
principal ruin, through which the abbey appears to great advantage
about four hundred yards beyond this arch.</p>

</div>
<p>Four miles from Byland is Coxwold, once the residence of the
celebrated Laurence Sterne, author of <i>Tristram Shandy</i>,
&amp;c. It is a beautiful and romantic retreat, excelling the
"laughing vine-clad hills of France," which attracted the spirit of
our English Rabelais to luxuriate amidst them. Here we gained
admittance to the little church, an interesting edifice, noted for
its sumptuous monuments to commemorate the Fauconbridge and
Belasyse families, and for its being the scene of Sterne's curacy.
A small barrel organ now graces its gallery, which responded to the
morning and evening service in Yorick's day. On prying about the
belfry we discovered an old helmet, with the gilding on it still
discernible, which we at first supposed to be intended as a
decoration to some tomb; but its weight and size precluded that
supposition. In the church of Coxwold, the moralist might amass
tomes of knowledge, and acquire the most forcible conviction of the
fleeting nature of earth and its possessors. On glancing around he
would perceive the heraldic honours of a most noble and ancient
family now extinct&mdash;the paltry remains of the splendid helmet,
which had decked, perhaps, the proud hero of feudal power, thrown
into a degrading hole with the sexton's spade, and the sacred
rostrum where the eloquence of the second Rabelais has astonished
the village auditors, and perhaps led them to doubt that such
intellect was mutable, now filled by another! Our curiosity was
attracted, on leaving the church, to Shandy Hall, once the
residence of Sterne, situated at the termination of the village.
Two females, elegantly attired in mourning, were parading the
garden; immediately I saw them I thought of the beautiful Eliza;
she to whom the fickle Yorick swore eternal attachment, and then
"lit up his heart at the shrine of another," leaving Eliza to
wonder&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;that fresh features</p>
<p>Have such a charm for us poor human creatures."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps in this edifice, Eugenius, (the witty Duke of
Wharton,<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
"#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>) and his boon companion, have sported
their puns and repartees over the glass; whilst the laughter-moving
Sterne, pursuing the dictates of his heart, has wet the dimpling
cheek of Eugenius by some random effusion of imagination and
sensibility. What two noble spirits have there displayed their
intellectual brilliance; and what a gratification to have heard the
author of "The Monk at Calais," and "My uncle Toby," eliciting
smiles and tears by turns, till the delighted heart could scarcely
determine whether joy or sorrow caused the most exquisite
feeling.</p>
<p>But to conclude our peregrination&mdash;the glory of Hode,
Rievaulx, and Byland abbeys has departed&mdash;their founders,
ecclesiastics and patrons, have become dust&mdash;the crumbling
arch and tottering pillar alone record "the whereabouts" of the
rendezvous of heroes and kings&mdash;and rooks construct their
dwellings where the silver crucifix once reared its massy form,
before crowds of adoring monks&mdash;the hoarse croak of the raven
is now heard through that valley where pealed the vesper bell; and
the melancholy music of the lonely river succeeds the solemn chant
of mass;&mdash;laugh and jest resound where monkish praise quivered
through the Gothic space&mdash;the helmet and coronet of blood and
birth are fallen from their wearers&mdash;and the genius and
eccentricity of Sterne, and the wit of Wharton, are for ever
extinct:</p>

<h3>CROMLEH IN ANGLESEA.</h3>
<div class="figure" style="width:100%;"><a href=
"images/328-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/328-2.png" alt=
"Comleh" /></a> Cromleh in Anglesea.</div>
<p>Cromlehs are among the most interesting of all monumental relics
of our ancestors; but the question of their original purposes has
excited much controversy among the lovers of antiquarian lore. They
are immense stones, by some believed to have been the altars, by
others, the tombs, of the Druids; but Mr. Toland explains the word
<i>cromleac</i>, or <i>cromleh</i>, from the Irish <i>crom</i>, to
adore, and <i>leac</i>, a stone&mdash;stone of adoration. Crom was
also one of the Irish names of God; hence cromleac may mean the
stone of Crom, or of the Supreme God. The cromleac is also called
<i>Bothal</i>, from the Irish word <i>Both</i>, a house, and
<i>al</i>, or <i>Allah</i>, God; this is evidently the same with
<i>Bethel</i>, or house of God, of the Hebrews.</p>
<p>The above vignette represents a Cromleh at Plas Newydd, the seat
of the Marquess of Anglesea, in the Isle of Anglesea. This part of
the island is finely wooded, and forcibly recalls to the mind its
ancient state, when it was the celebrated seat of the Druids, the
terrific rites of whose religion were performed in the gloom of the
thickest groves.</p>
<p>The Cromleh at Plas Newydd is 12 feet 9 inches long, and 13 feet
2 inches broad, in the broadest part. Its greatest depth or
thickness is 5 feet. Its contents cannot be less in cubic feet and
decimal parts than 392,878,125. It follows, therefore, from
calculating according to the specific gravity of stone of its kind,
that it cannot weigh less than 30 tons 7 hundreds. The engraving is
copied from "The Celtic Druids," by Godfrey Higgins, Esq. F.S.A.
4to, 1827, one of the most valuable antiquarian volumes it has ever
been our good fortune to secure; and by the aid of an esteemed
correspondent, we hope shortly to introduce a few of its
curiosities more in detail than we are enabled to do at
present.</p>

<h3>CLAUDE LORRAINE.</h3>
<p>Lanzi, in his <i>History of Italian Painting</i>, gives the
following exquisite encomium on this prince of landscape
painters:</p>
<p>"His landscapes present to the spectator an endless variety; so
many views of land and water, so many interesting objects, that,
like an astonished traveller, the eye is obliged to pause and
measure the extent of the prospect, and his distances of mountain
and of sea, are so illusive, that the spectator feels, as it were,
fatigued by gazing. The edifices and temples which so finely round
off his compositions, the lakes peopled with aquatic birds, the
foliage diversified in conformity to the different kinds of trees,
all is nature in him; every object arrests the attention of an
amateur, every thing furnishes instruction to a professor. There is
not an effect of light, or a reflection in water which he has not
imitated; and the various changes of the day are nowhere better
represented than in Claude. In a word, he is truly the painter who,
in depicting the three regions of air, earth, and water, has
combined the whole universe. His atmosphere almost always bears the
impress of the sky at Rome, whose horizon is, from its situation,
rosy, dewy, and warm. He did not possess any peculiar merit in his
figures, which are insipid, and generally too much attenuated;
hence he was accustomed to remark to the purchasers of his
pictures, that he sold them the landscape, and presented them with
the figures gratis."</p>
<hr />
<p>"TINTORETTO," says his biographer, "produced works in which the
most captious of critics could not find a shade of defect."</p>
<hr />
<h3>KISSING THE FOOT.</h3>
<p>Rollo, the celebrated Danish hero, (whose stature is said to
have been so gigantic, that no horse could carry him) on becoming a
feudatory of the French crown, was required, in conformity with
general usage, to kiss the foot of his superior lord; but he
refused to stoop to what he considered so great a degradation; yet
as the homage could not be dispensed with, he ordered one of his
warriors to perform it for him. The latter, as proud as his chief,
instead of stooping to the royal foot, raised it so high, that the
poor monarch fell to the ground, amid the laughter of the
assembly.</p>

<h3>REVIEWING.</h3>
<p>There are three ways of reviewing a book. First, to take no more
notice of it, or of its author, than if neither the one nor the
other had ever been produced&mdash;cautiously to avoid the most
distant allusions to their names, characters, or professions,
thereby avoiding all personality, in their case at least, all
intrusion, either into public or private life. Secondly, to select
all the good passages, and to comment upon them with such power and
vivacity, that beside your pearls they seem paste. Thirdly, to
select all the best passages, and to string them all together on a
very slight thread&mdash;like dew-drops on gossamer&mdash;and
boldly palm it upon the public as an original
article.&mdash;<i>Blackwood's Mag</i>.</p>

<h3>THE PINE-APPLE.</h3>
<p>Oviedo extols the pine-apple above all the fruits which grew in
the famous gardens of his time, and above all that he had tasted in
his travels in Spain, France, England, Germany, the whole of Italy,
Sicily, the Tyrol, and the whole of the Low Countries. "No fruit,"
says he, "have I known or seen in all these parts, nor do I think
that in the world there is one better than it, or equal to it, in
all those points which I shall now mention, and which are, beauty
of appearance, sweetness of smell, taste of excellent savour; so
that there being three senses out of the five which can be
gratified by fruit, such is its excellence above all other fruits
or dainties in the world, that it gratifies those three, and even
the fourth also; to wit the touch. As for the fifth, that is to
say, the hearing, fruit, indeed, can neither hear nor listen, but
in its place the reader may hear and attend to what is said of this
fruit, and he will perceive that I do not deceive <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> myself
in what I shall say of it. For albeit fruit can as little be said
to possess any of the other four senses, in relation to the which I
have, as above, spoken, of these I am to be understood in the
exercise and person of him who eats, not of the fruit itself, which
hath no life, save the vegetative one, and wants both the sensitive
and rational, all three of which exist in man. And he, looking at
these pines, and smelling to them, and tasting them, and feeling
them, will justly, considering these four parts or particularities,
attribute to it the principality above all other fruits."</p>

<h3>STONE-MASON'S CRITICISM</h3>
<p>Mr. Bowles, the vicar of Bremhill, Wilts, is accustomed
occasionally to write epitaphs for the young and aged dead among
his own parishioners. An epitaph of his, on an aged father and
mother, written in the character of a most exemplary son&mdash;the
father living to eighty-seven years&mdash;ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"My father&mdash;my poor mother&mdash;both are gone,</p>
<p>And o'er your cold remains I place this stone,</p>
<p>In memory of your virtues. May it tell</p>
<p>How <i>long one</i> parent lived, and <i>both</i> how well,"</p>
<p class="i2">&amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When this was shown to the stone-mason critic, (and Mr. Bowles
acknowledges he has heard worse public critics in his time,) he
observed, that the lines <i>might</i> do with a <i>little</i>
alteration&mdash;thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"My father, and my mother too, are dead,</p>
<p>And here I <i>put</i> this grave-stone at their head;</p>
<p>My father lived to eighty-seven, my mother</p>
<p>No quite <i>so long</i>&mdash;and <i>one</i> died after
<i>t'other</i>."</p>

<h3>PLEASURES OF HISTORY.</h3>
<p>The effect of historical reading is analogous, in many respects
to that produced by foreign travel. The student, like the tourist,
is transported into a new state of society. He sees new fashions.
He hears new modes of expression. His mind enlarged by
contemplating the wide diversities of laws, of morals, of manners.
But men may travel far, and return with minds as contracted as if
they had never retired from their own market-towns. In the same
manner, men may know the dates of many battles, and the genealogies
of many noble houses, and yet be no wiser. Most people look at past
times, as princes look at foreign countries. More than one
illustrious stranger has landed on our island amidst the shouts of
a mob, has dined with the king, has hunted with the master of the
stag-hounds, has seen the guards reviewed, and a Knight of the
Garter installed; has cantered along Regent-street; has visited St.
Paul's, and noted down its dimensions, and has then departed,
thinking that he has seen England. He has, in fact, seen a few
public buildings, public men, and public ceremonies. But of the
vast and complex system of society, of the fine shades of national
character, of the practical operation of government and laws, he
knows nothing.&mdash;<i>Edin. Rev.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>CHARMS OF SAVAGE LIFE.</h3>
<p>It is remarkable that whites or creoles do not always avail
themselves of opportunities to return to civilized society. There
seem to be pleasures in savage life, which those who have once
tasted, seldom wish to exchange for the charms of more polished
intercourse. For example, a creole boy was carried off at the age
of 13; at 26 he returned to Buenos Ayres, on some speculation of
barter. He said that whoever had lived upon horse-flesh would never
eat beef, unless driven by necessity or hunger; he described the
flesh of a colt to be the most deliciously flavoured of all viands.
This man, having transacted the business which led him to Buenos
Ayres, returned voluntarily to his native haunts, and is probably
living amongst the Indians to this day.&mdash;<i>Mem. Gen.
Miller</i>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>PATRONS OF ASTRONOMY.</h3>
<p>The Emperor of Russia has presented to the Observatory of
Dorpat, a magnificent telescope by Franenhofer, with a focal length
of 13 feet, and an aperture of 9 inches; the cost was &pound;1,300.
The king of Bavaria followed his example by ordering a still finer
instrument for the same purpose; and the king of France, with a
liberality still more patriotic, has had executed in his own
capital, an achromatic telescope, surpassing them all in magnitude
and power. What a misfortune it is to English science, that the
name of the most accomplished prince who has as yet occupied the
throne of Charles I. does not appear in the list of sovereigns, who
have been thus rivalling each other in the patronage of astronomy!
What a mortification to English feeling, that the subject of
sidereal astronomy created by the munificence of George III. should
thus be transferred to the patronage of foreign monarchs. A slight
exception must be made in the case of Edinburgh. During the King's
visit, the observatory had permission to take the name of the
<i>Royal Observatory of George IV.</i>; and it has received from
government &pound;2,000. to purchase
instruments.&mdash;<i>Quarterly Rev</i>.</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS</h2>
<h3>DINNERS.</h3>
<p>A Family Dinner! Pot-luck, as it is called, in
Scotland&mdash;when the man's wife is in the sulks, the wife's man
proportionably savage, the children blear-eyed from the recent
blubber in the nursery&mdash;the governess afraid to lift her eyes
from her plate&mdash;the aunt sourer than the vinegar
cruet&mdash;and we&mdash;alas! the stranger, stepping in to take
pot-luck&mdash;we, poor old Christopher North, thanklessly
volunteering to help the cock-y-leekie, that otherwise would
continue to smoke and steam unstirred in its truly classical
utensil! What looking of inutterable things! As impossible to break
the silence with your tongue, as to break pond-ice ten inches thick
with your knuckle. In comes the cock that made the cock-y-leekie,
boiled down in his tough antiquity to a tatter. He disappears among
the progeny, and you are now tied to the steak. You find there
employment sufficient to justify any silence; and hope during
mastication that you have not committed any crime since Christmas,
of an enormity too great to be expiated by condemnation to the
sulks.</p>
<p>A Literary Dinner! apparently the remains of the Seven Young Men
sprinkled along both sides of the table&mdash;with here and there
"a three-times skimmed sky-blue" interposed; on each side of the
Lord of the Mansion, a philosopher&mdash;on each hand of the lady,
a poet&mdash;somewhere or other about the board, a Theatrical
Star&mdash;a Strange Fiddler&mdash;an Outlandish

naughtily sayeth,</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Will not a single soul in all this wide world, as he hopes to be
saved, utter so much as one solitary syllable? Oh! what would not
the lady and the gentleman of the house give even for a remark on
the weather from the mouth of poet, philosopher, sage, or hero!
Hermetically sealed! Lo! the author of the very five-guinea quarto,
that lay open, in complimentary exposure, at a plate, up stairs on
the drawing-room table&mdash;with his round unmeaning face
"breathing tranquillity"&mdash;sound asleep! With eyes fixed on the
ceiling, sits at his side the profound Parent of a Treatise on the
Sinking Fund. The absent gentleman, who has kept stroking his chin
for the last half hour, as if considering how he is off for
soap,&mdash;would you believe it,&mdash;has just returned from
abroad, and has long been justly celebrated for his conversational
talents in all the coteries and courts of Europe. If that
lank-and-leather-jawed gentleman, with complexion bespeaking a
temperament dry and adust, and who has long been sedulously
occupied in feeling the edge of his fruit-knife with the ball of
his thumb&mdash;do not commit suicide before
September,&mdash;Lavater must have been as great a goose as Gall.
You might not only hear a mouse stirring&mdash;a pin
dropping&mdash;but either event would rouse the whole company like
a peal of thunder. You may have seen Madame Toussaud's
images,&mdash;Napoleon, Wellington, Scott, Canning, all sitting
together, in full fig, with faces and figures in opposite
directions, each looking as like himself as possible, so that you
could almost believe you heard them speak. You get rather
angry&mdash;you wonder that they don't speak. Even so with those
living images. But the exhibition is over&mdash;the ladies leave
the room&mdash;and after another hour of silence, more profound
than that of the grave, all the images simultaneously rise up

<h2>SELECT BIOGRAPHY</h2>
<h3>LEDYARD THE TRAVELLER.</h3>
<h4><i>Concluded from page 113</i>.</h4>
<p>Ledyard was one of the marines who were present at Cook's death,
of which he gives an account (as appears from extracts of his
journal already mentioned,) somewhat different from that in the
authentic narrative of the voyage&mdash;and different, also, we
must add, from his own private journal, which, at least the portion
of it relating to that event, is still in the Admiralty. It must be
mentioned in favour of Ledyard's sagacity, that the visit to Nootka
Sound suggested to him the commercial advantages to be derived from
a trade between the north-west coast of America and China; and the
views which he took of this subject very much influenced the
succeeding events of his life.</p>
<p>Towards the end of December, 1782, we find Ledyard serving on
board a king's ship in Long Island Sound, from which he obtained
leave of absence to visit his mother; but, either from a sense of
duty and honour, which obliged him not to act with the enemies of
his country, or from a dislike of the service, he never returned.
He had conceived, and now began to endeavour to execute, the grand
project of a trading voyage to Nootka; for this purpose he went to
New York and Philadelphia, and, after addressing himself to various
individuals, he prevailed at last on the Honourable Robert Morris
to promise him a ship. The projected voyage, however, was
ultimately abandoned.</p>
<p>Finding, nevertheless, that they all failed him, and heartily
sick of the want of enterprise among his own countrymen, he
resolved to try his fortune in Europe. He visited Cadiz, from
thence took a passage to Brest, and from Brest to L'Orient, where
he was successful in prevailing on some merchants to fit out a ship
for his north-west adventure; but this project also failed, and
Ledyard became once more the sport of accident.</p>
<p>He now proceeded to Paris, where he was received with great
kindness by Mr. Jefferson, the American minister, who so highly
approved of his favourite scheme of an expedition to the north-west
coast, that, we are told by his biographer, the journey of Lewis
and Clarke, twenty years afterwards, had its origin in the views
which Jefferson received from Ledyard. Here, also, he met with the
notorious Paul Jones, who was looking after the proceeds of the
prizes which he had taken and carried into the ports of France.
This adventurer entered warmly into his views, and undertook to fit
out two vessels for the expedition. It was settled that Jones was
to command the vessels, and carry the furs to the China market,
while Ledyard was to remain behind and collect a fresh cargo ready
for their return, after which he meant to perambulate the continent
of America, and show his countrymen the path to unbounded wealth.
Jones, it seems, was so much taken with the plausibility of a
scheme, which presented at once the prospect of adventure, fame,
and profit, that he advanced money to Ledyard to purchase a part of
the cargo for the outfit; but, being suddenly called away to
L'Orient, to look after his prize concerns, his zeal for this grand
scheme began to cool, and, in a few months, the whole fabric fell
to the ground.</p>
<p>Ledyard now felt himself a sort of wandering vagabond, without
employment, motive, or means of support; the supplies he had
received from Jones had ceased, and he was compelled to become a
pensioner on the bounty of the American minister and a few friends.
It would appear, however, from some lively letters written by him
at Paris, that his flow of spirits did not forsake him.</p>
<p>"The two Fitzhughs," he says, "dine with me to-day in my
chamber, together with our worthy consul, Barclay, and that lump of
universality, colonel Franks. But such a set of moneyless rascals
have never appeared, since the epoch of the happy villain Falstaff.
I have but five French crowns in the world; Franks has not a sol;
and the Fitzhughs cannot get their tobacco money. Every day of my
life," he continues, "is a day of expectation, and, consequently, a
day of disappointment; whether I shall have a morsel of bread to
eat at the end of two <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name=
"page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> months, is as much an uncertainty as
it was fourteen months ago, and not more so."</p>
<p>While in this state of penury he received a visit, the object of
which was so creditable to a gentleman still living, and not
unknown in the annals of science, that it gives us pleasure to
print the story in Ledyard's own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Permit me to relate to you an incident. About a fortnight ago,
Sir James Hall,<a id="footnotetag8" name=
"footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> an English
gentleman, on his way from Paris to Cherbourg, stopped his coach at
our door, and came up to my chamber. I was in bed at six o'clock in
the morning, but having flung on my <i>robe de chambre</i>, I met
him at the door of the ante-chamber. I was glad to see him, but
surprised. He observed, that he had endeavoured to make up his
opinion of me, with as much exactness as possible, and concluded
that no kind of visit whatever would surprise me. I could do no
otherwise than remark, that his <i>opinion</i> surprised me at
least, and the conversation took another turn. In walking across
the chamber, he laughingly put his hand on a six livre piece, and a
louis d'or that lay on my table, and with a half stifled blush,
asked me how I was in the money way. Blushes commonly beget
blushes, and I blushed partly because he did, and partly on other
accounts. 'If fifteen guineas,' said he, interrupting the answer he
had demanded, 'will be of any service to you, there they are,' and
he put them on the table. 'I am a traveller myself, and though I
have some fortune to support my travels, yet I have been so
situated as to want money, which you ought not to do. You have my
address in London.' He then wished me a good morning and left me.
This gentleman was a total stranger to the situation of my
finances, and one that I had, by mere accident, met at an ordinary
in Paris."</p>
<p>Ledyard observes, that he had no more idea of receiving money
from this gentleman than from Tippoo Saib. "However," he says, "I
took it without any hesitation, and told him, I would be as
complaisant to him if ever occasion offered."</p>
<p>His schemes for a north-west voyage, either for trade or
discovery, being now wholly abandoned, he set about planning, as
the only remaining expedient, a journey by land through the
northern regions of Europe and Asia, then to cross Behring's
Straits to the continent of America, to proceed down the coast to a
more southern latitude, and to cross the whole of that continent
from the western to the eastern shore. The empress of Russia was
applied to for her permission and protection, but while waiting for
her answer Ledyard received an invitation to London from his
eccentric friend, Sir James Hall. He found, on his arrival there,
that an English ship was in complete readiness to sail for the
Pacific Ocean, in which Sir James had procured him a free passage,
and to be put on shore at any spot he might choose on the
north-west coast. The amiable baronet, moreover, presented him with
twenty guineas, as Ledyard says, <i>pro bono publico</i>, and with
which he tells us, "he bought two great dogs, an Indian pipe, and a
hatchet." In a few days the vessel went down the Thames from
Deptford, and Ledyard thought it the happiest moment of his life;
but such is the uncertainty of human expectations, while he was
indulging in day-dreams of the fame and honour which awaited him,
he was once more doomed to suffer the agonies of a disappointment
to his hopes, the more severe, as being so near their
consummation&mdash;the vessel was seized by a custom-house officer,
brought back, and exchequered.</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly the most severe blow he had yet received;
but Ledyard never desponded&mdash;no sooner was one of his castles
demolished, than he set about building another. "I shall make the
tour of the globe," he says, "from London eastward, on foot." To
aid him in this object, a subscription was raised by Sir Joseph
Banks, Sir James Hall, and some others. By this means he arrived at
Hamburgh; whence he writes to colonel Smith:&mdash;"Here I am with
ten guineas exactly, and in perfect health. One of my dogs is no
more: I lost him in my passage up the river Elbe, in a snow storm:
I was out in it forty hours in an open boat."</p>
<p>At the tavern he went to, he learnt that a Major Langhorn, an
American officer, "a very good kind of a man," as his host
described him, "and an odd kind of a man, one who had travelled
much, and fond of travelling in his own way," had left his baggage
behind, which was sent after him to Copenhagen, but that, by some
accident, it had never reached him. He had left Hamburgh, the host
told him, with one spare shirt, and very few other articles of
clothing, and added, that he must necessarily be in distress. This
man, thought Ledyard to himself, is just suited to be the companion
of my travels. The sympathy was irresistible; besides, he might be
in want of money; this was an appeal to his generosity, which was
equally <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name=
"page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> irresistible to one who, like
Ledyard, had ten guineas in his pocket. "I will fly to him and lay
my little all at his feet: he is my countryman, a gentleman, and a
traveller, and Copenhagen is not much out of my way to
Petersburgh," and, accordingly, in the month of January, 1787,
after a long and tedious journey, in the middle of winter, through
Sweden and Finland, we find him in Copenhagen, having discovered
Langhorn shut up in his room, without being able to stir abroad for
want of money and decent clothing. After remaining a fortnight, he
made a proposal to the Major to accompany him to St. Petersburgh.
"No: I esteem you, but no man on earth shall travel with me the way
I do," was the abrupt refusal to the man who had gone out of the
way several hundred miles to relieve his wants, and given him his
last shilling.</p>
<p>The visit being ended, and the amicable partnership dissolved,
it became necessary for our traveller to think of raising the
supplies for a journey round the Gulf of Bothnia, which was now
rendered impassable, the distance being not less than twelve
hundred miles, chiefly over trackless snows, in regions thinly
peopled, the nights long, and the cold intense; and, after all,
gaining only, in the direct route, about fifty miles. A Mr.
Thompson accepted his bill on Colonel Smith, for a sum which, he
says, "has saved me from perdition, and will enable me to reach
Petersburgh." This journey he accomplished within seven weeks; but
he writes to Mr. Jefferson, "I cannot tell you by what means I
came, and hardly know by what means I shall quit it." Through the
influence of Professor Pallas, but more especially by the
assistance of a Russian officer, he obtained the passport of the
empress, then on her route to the Crimea, in fifteen days. His long
and dreary journey having exhausted his money, and worn out his
clothes, he drew on Sir Joseph Banks for twenty guineas, which that
munificent patron of science and enterprise did not hesitate to
pay.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a Scotch physician, of the name of Brown, was
proceeding in the service of the empress as far as the province of
Kolyvan, who offered him a seat in his kabitka, and thus assisted
him on his journey for more than three thousand miles. Having
reached Irkutsk, he remained there about ten days, and left it in
company with lieutenant Laxman, a Swedish officer, to embark on the
Lena, at a point one hundred and fifty miles distant from Irkutsk,
with the intention of floating down its current to Yakutsk. On his
arrival at this place, he waited on the commandant, told him he
wished to press forward, with all expedition, to Okotsk before the
winter should shut in, that he might secure an early passage in the
spring to the American continent. The commandant assured him that
such a journey was already impossible; that the governor-general,
from whom he had brought letters, ordered him to show all possible
kindness and service, "and the first and best service," said he,
"is to beseech you not to attempt to reach Okotsk this winter."
Ledyard still persisting to proceed, a trader was brought in, who,
in like manner, declared the journey utterly impracticable.</p>
<p>While thus detained for the winter at Yakutsk, he drew up some
very just observations on the Tartars, which were afterwards
published.</p>
<p>He had not remained long at Yakutsk, when Captain Billings
returned from the Kolyma. This officer had attended the astronomer
Bayley, as his assistant, on the last voyage of Cook, and was, of
course, well known to Ledyard. Being on his journey to Irkutsk, he
invited Ledyard to accompany him thither. They travelled in sledges
up the Lena, and reached Irkutsk in seventeen days, being a
distance of fifteen hundred miles. Scarcely, however, had he
arrived at this place when he was put under arrest, by an order
from the empress. He now experienced no more of that concern for
his welfare on the part of the commandant, and even Billings kept
away from him. All he could learn was, that he was considered as a
French spy, which Billings could at once have contradicted. His
state of suspense was very short, as, on the same day, he was sent
off in a kabitka, with two guards, one on each side.</p>
<p>In this manner was our traveller conveyed to the frontiers of
Poland, a distance of six thousand versts, in six weeks. "Thank
heaven," says he, as he approached Poland, "petticoats appear, and
the glimmerings of other features. Women are the sure harbingers of
an alteration in manners, in approaching a country where their
influence is felt." He has bestowed, indeed, a beautiful and
touching tribute to the excellence of the female character, not
more beautiful than just, which cannot be too often recorded in
print.</p>
<p>On setting our traveller down in Poland, the soldiers who had
guarded him, gave him to understand that he might then go where he
pleased; but that, if he again returned to the dominions of the
empress, he would certainly be hanged. It did not appear for some
time what the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name=
"page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> real cause was of this proceeding;
but there is every reason to believe it arose out of the jealousy
of the North-west Russian Fur Company, whose head-quarters were at
Irkutsk, and that their influence at Petersburgh had procured from
the empress the annulment of her previous order, together with the
present inhuman mandate. Ledyard, however, knew nothing of this;
and, having neither relish nor motive for making the experiment a
second time, he took the shortest route to Konigsberg, where he
found himself destitute, without friends or means, his hopes
blasted, and his health enfeebled. In this forlorn condition, he
bethought himself once more of the benevolence of Sir Joseph Banks,
and had the good luck to raise five guineas, by a draft on his old
benefactor, with which he reached London. Here he was kindly
received by Sir Joseph Banks, who gave him an introduction to Mr.
Beaufoy, the secretary of a newly-formed association for promoting
discoveries in Africa.</p>
<p>"Before," says Mr. Beaufoy, "I had learnt from the note the name
and business of my visitor, I was struck with the manliness of his
person, the breadth of his chest, the openness of his countenance
and the inquietude of his eye. I spread the map of Africa before
him, and tracing a line from Cairo to Sennaar, and from thence
westward in the latitude and supposed direction of the Niger, I
told him, that was the route, by which I was anxious that Africa
might, if possible, be explored. He said, he should think himself
singularly fortunate to be trusted with the adventure. I asked him
when he would set out. 'To-morrow morning,' was his answer. I told
him I was afraid that we should not be able, in so short a time, to
prepare his instructions, and to procure for him the letters that
were requisite; but that if the committee should approve of his
proposal, all expedition should be used."</p>
<p>In a few weeks all was ready for his departure. The plan was, to
proceed up the Nile as far as Sennaar or the Babr-el-Abiad, and
from thence to strike across the African continent to the coast of
the Atlantic.</p>
<p>His letters from Cairo are full of interest. Of the Nile itself
he speaks contemptuously, says it resembles the Connecticut in
size, or may be compared with the Thames.</p>
<p>After some delay, the day is fixed on which the caravan is to
leave Cairo. He writes to his friends and to the African
Association in great spirits; talks of cutting the continent
across, and raises the expectations of his employers to a high
pitch;&mdash;the very next letters from Cairo brought the
melancholy intelligence of his death. It seems he was seized with a
bilious complaint, for which he administered a strong solution of
vitriolic acid, so powerful as to produce violent and burning
pains, that threatened to be fatal unless immediate relief could be
procured, which was attempted to be got by a powerful dose of
tartar emetic. His death happened about the end of December, 1788,
in the thirty-eighth year of his age.</p>
<p>Thus perished, in the vigour of manhood, the first victim, in
modern times, to African discovery. Too many, alas! have since
shared the same fate in pursuit of the same object; which, so far
from deterring, seems only to stimulate others, and produce fresh
candidates for fame to tread the same perilous
path.&mdash;<i>Quarterly Review&mdash;Article "Ledyard's
Travels."</i></p>

<p>The immense large bonnets which decorate the ladies of the
present day are truly "<i>over the borders</i>," and seem to keep
pace with the "<i>march of intellect</i>." A garden seems to bloom
on their exterior, and roses and lilies vie with each other above
and below, for underneath the living roses flourish on the cheeks
of the fair. Perhaps in a few years small bonnets will usurp the
day, for</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
